This past year I've been working on a couple of Three.js projects. Here are a few:

1. [3D Spider-Man Portfolio](https://r3f-project.vercel.app/)
2. [Trappist-1 Experience](https://fp-experience.vercel.app/)
3. [SB-129](https://sb-129.com/), inspired by SpongeBob SquarePants.

Having done games before, Three.js seemed like the natural choice to join web development and 3D modelling. All assets are my own.

# [3D Spider-Man Portfolio](https://r3f-project.vercel.app/)

This was made for Insomniac Games' Development Support intern position in summer 2023. It includes three sections - about, 3D and a computer which shows my blog and projects. The 3D section contains all assets I made inspired by Spider-Man 2, which released the same year.

# [Trappist-1 Experience](https://fp-experience.vercel.app/)

A fan of sci-fi and the prospect of living on other planets, this website was made with inspiration from drawings I made as a kid, primarily this one:

It's a simple platformer, with high-fidelity assets. The game was a more playful, simple style before the addition of detailed textures, sounds and other environment details.

# [SB-129](https://sb-129.com/)

SB-129 was taken in inspiration from the episode with the same name from SpongeBob SquarePants. In it, Squidward is lost in a world he is unfamiliar with. I used the show's general aesthetic to create a third-person shooter with characters from the episode.

In the future it's planned that these websites will follow a more simple aesthetic, with a more meditative focus.
