This post documents the three.js websites I've made.

# [3D Spider-Man Portfolio](https://r3f-project.vercel.app/)

This was made for Insomniac Games' Development Support intern position in summer 2023. It has a lot of technical art inspired by Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which released the same year. You can view them by clicking on the box to the top left.

(Update) Recently made some tweaks to the scene:

# [Trappist-1 Experience](https://fp-experience.vercel.app/)

This website was inspired by drawings I made in high school.

I rendered out a basic scene.

I then decided to make it realistic. Once the player turns around, they'll be prompted to participate in a platformer.

# [SB-129](https://sb-129.com/)

SB-129 was inspired from an episode of the same name from SpongeBob SquarePants, S1E14.

Starting with a simple character controller, a basic model was used to set up the animation controller, with help from the [pmdrs/ecctrl](https://github.com/pmndrs/ecctrl) repository for physics and motion.

Afterwards props and enemy functionality were added. Squidward can shoot, kick and swing his clarinet to defend himself from an unending wave of SpongeBobs (robot form). Also made my own Squidward model.

# [Paddle](https://paddle-olive.vercel.app/)

![Paddle reference](/images/paddle/paddle-ref.jpeg)

I modelled this one after Paper Mill Lake in Nova Scotia.

# The future

Since I wrote this post there's been a few more projects I've worked on, including a [multiplayer](https://github.com/jerryliangxia/pepes-room) game and [ragdoll sim](https://ragdoll-example.vercel.app/).

I made one more app that takes in a context and lays out future paths based on it. It's called [watdo.me](https://watdo-eta.vercel.app/)
