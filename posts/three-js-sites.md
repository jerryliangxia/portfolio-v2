This past year I've been working with Three.js. Here are a few of the projects I made.

# [3D Spider-Man Portfolio](https://r3f-project.vercel.app/)

This was made for Insomniac Games' Development Support intern position in summer 2023. It includes technical art inspired by Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which released the same year. This can be prompted by clicking the box to the left.

Recently added assets include a prop circling the scene and some clouds. This, along with the environment, is inspired by a scene from the first game.

# [Trappist-1 Experience](https://fp-experience.vercel.app/)

This website was inspired by drawings I made as a kid, primarily this one:

A basic model was rendered before high fidelity assets were added.

The final result is below. Once the player turns around, they'll be prompted to participate in a challenging platformer. This project includes SFX and music.

# [SB-129](https://sb-129.com/)

SB-129 was inspired from an episode of the same name from SpongeBob SquarePants, season 1 episode 14.

Starting with a simple character controller, a basic model was used to set up the animation controller, with help from the [pmdrs/ecctrl](https://github.com/pmndrs/ecctrl) repository for physics and motion.

Afterwards props and enemy functionality were added. Squidward can shoot, kick and swing his clarinet to defend himself from an unending wave of SpongeBobs (robot form).

# [Paddle](https://paddle-olive.vercel.app/)

This site is a relaxing trip through childhood memories.

# Onwards

In the future it's planned to create experiences with a simpler aesthetic, with a more meditative focus.
