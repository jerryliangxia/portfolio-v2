# [Planets of Trappist-1](https://fp-experience.vercel.app/)

This website was inspired by drawings made in high school:

Created a basic scene:

Added realism. There's a 3D platformer you can play in the background.

# [SB-129](https://sb-129.com/)

SB-129 was inspired from SpongeBob S1E14.

A basic model was used to set up with [pmdrs/ecctrl](https://github.com/pmndrs/ecctrl)'s animation controller.

Afterwards props and player actions were added. Squidward can shoot, kick and swing his clarinet to defend himself from robot SpongeBobs.

# [Paddle](https://paddle-olive.vercel.app/)

This was modelled after Paper Mill Lake in Nova Scotia, where I grew up.
